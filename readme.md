# Memory Form

## About

Too often users are filling out a form or survey and the accidently reload the page and lose all their hard work filling out that form. No more!

It works by saving everytime a users inputs data to a session in local storage. This way the data will be removed as soon as the browser is restarted.

## Usage

Simply download the script and include it in your html view file. Ideally in the footer is best, but whereever is fine.
